upstream/main and origin/main
fork repo copies at a point in time, changes may merge into main repo
to prevent loss of work, 'git pull upstream main' to your main repo, then 'git push origin main'. 
this will keep everything in sync
good practice is to never commit to your main branch. stable, not for development. development should be in its own isolated area
