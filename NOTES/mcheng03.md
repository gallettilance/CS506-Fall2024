1. Main repository on Github - upstream/main
2. My own repository on Github - origin/main
3. My own local repository on Github - main

- to create notes: fork the repo, clone the forked repo, create a new branch

- 'git pull upstream main' would allow us to pull from the (1) into (3)
- 'git push origin main' would allow us to push (3) into (2)
- make sure to branch off main to develop since you want the main branch to be stable
    - if there are any issues on the main branch, then you can simply delete

- its impossible to perfectly quantify or capture relationships, there can also be inherent randomness
    - hard to find things (say, X and Y) that are perfectly related to each other
    - all the models we are going to create are going to be wrong, however, we could still make models that are useful

- simplified data science workflow: (1) process day, (2) explore data, (3) extract features, and (4) create model
    - note that we can return to the previous step
