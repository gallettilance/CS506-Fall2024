1. Main repository on Github - upstream/main
2. My own repository on Github - origin/main
3. My own local repository on Github - main


- 'git pull upstream main' would allow us to pull from the (1) into (3). 
- 'git push origin main' would allow us to push (3) into (2).
- make sure to branch off main to develop since you want the main branch to be stable. 
    - if there are any issues on the main branch, then you can simply delete.


Testing my new develop branch.
