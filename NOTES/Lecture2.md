## GITHUB REVIEW
- in order to collaborate on a repo without overwhelming with too many changes, you can fork the repo and create a pull request (what we are doing now)
- trying to contribute at main repository (think of them as a other branches):
- 1. for the repository and then clone it
  2. add remotes - origin points to your repository upstream points to the repository you are trying to contribute to
  3. then work in your repo, add, commit then it will create a pull request 

### How to keep up to date to main repo
- one thing -> delete everything and pork again. But you lose everything
- proper way is to sync from the actuall repo your forked from

### Main branch
- My main branch is special it is not a place to develop the new features
- Make a new branch and develop it. If you screw it over then delete the branch!
  
## Linear Algebra
- hard to tell what exact factors contribute to a given result 
- need to know under which circumstances a hypothesis is made false (what data points makes it wrong)
- y = f(x) gives us an idea of how the data trends, but there will still be variation 
- confirmation bias -- just because you feel like you see relationship, doesn't necessarily mean that it is there(?)
- working with a finite set of points and asked to find this relationship
- positive example supports hypothesis; negative doesn't
